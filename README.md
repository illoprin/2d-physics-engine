# Basic 2D Physics engine
### Python

Created by 3 days basic physics engine gives possability to move primitives by screen. Objects can be given impulse, collided and moved.

## Work meaning
Initially, I conceived the development of a 2D physics engine for subsequent implementation in 3D space for my 3D OpenGL engine on Python. But somehow this idea froze. I will probably return later


Thats all 😁😁
